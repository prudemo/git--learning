<p class="one"><b>In the United States, a government shutdown happens 
when there is a gap in federal funding and the <q>government</q> furloughs federal workers without pay. 
Although there are exceptions for certain “essential” employees 
(including the president and members of Congress,all of whom continue to receive pay) 
a shutdown means that a large portion of the federal government stops functioning.
The 1986 shutdown played out much like the one in 1984: the government furloughed about 500,000 federal employees for half a day, and
Democrats conceded to Reagan’s demands in order to end the shutdown.
The last funding gap during Reagan’s presidency happened in December 1987, 
but Congress averted a shutdown by quickly passing a bill that again provided funding to the Contras. 
This was just months after Congress had held hearings on the Iran-Contra Affair.</b></p>
